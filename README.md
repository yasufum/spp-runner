What is this?
=============

Management tool for SPP and VMs.


#### SPP

[SPP](http://www.dpdk.org/browse/apps/spp/)
is a kind of Inter-VM communication technology.
SPP is implemented mainly on Intel DPDK and
provides two interfaces for VMs, ring(ivshmem) and vhost.


How to use
==========

#### 1. Directory structure

This tool is assumed to use with other two tools,
`qemu-setup` and `spp-vm-installer`.

You have to put all tools in a directory before run it.

```sh
# check tools are placed in the same dir
$ ls
qemu-setup  spp-runner  spp-vm-installer ...
```

#### 2. Prepare VM image

First, you need to prepare an image as base template,
"base" means that there are other two templates for
ring and vhost VMs.
Two of them are generated by using base tempalte.

Put base template image in `runscripts` directory.

  ```sh
  $ cp /path/to/base-temp runscripts/
  ```

I have tested only `ubuntu16.04-server-amd64`, so
it's recommended.

[NOTE] Default type of image is `qcow2`, but you can use
other types by editing `ring.sh` and `vhost.sh` in
`qemu-setup/runscripts`.


#### 3. Configuration

#### 4. Generate templates for ring and vhost VMs

VMs are booted from `wakeup.py`
